My name is **Kevin Deldycke**, I'm a high-tech Engineering Manager.


## Short Bio

I've held various positions in several industries and sectors as VP, Product Manager, Founding Engineer and Consultant.

After 15+ years of relevant engineering work, and 3+ years of hands-on management experience, I now build teams from scratch with self-sustaining culture, and my intent is to keep doing so.

Enabling engineers, leading managers, and make them feel productive is the most impactful thing I can bring to the table. So I'm always **on the lookout for a high-tech management position, at a fast growing start-up** with ambitious vision.

My most relevant experience was in [growing a team from 0 to 12](https://devtomanager.com/interviews/kevin-deldycke/) at a [world-class cloud computing provider](https://scaleway.com). We built up the whole [IAM ecosystem](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-iam), as well as the [Billing and Payment stack](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-billing).

- 💰 Designed, implemented and operated [Scaleway's billing
pipeline](https://web.archive.org/web/20190315172559/https://scaleway.com/faq/billing/), generating
multi-million dollars of revenue (and growing!). The whole
thing. All by myself.

- 🚀 Then I built a team of 12 people to enhance and expand on the full Billing, Payment and IAM domain of the company. In doing so, I was given the fancy title of Product Manager, then VP.
